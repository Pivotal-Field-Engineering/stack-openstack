# Bug in Neutron nova notification code does not include
# the insecure attribute when notifying nova regarding
# the creation of a VIF. This results in a timeout and
# nova-compute rolling back the VM creation.

# Error during creation of a VM on KVM indicates that
# Nova cannot find /var/run/libvirt/libvirt-sock. It was
# discovered that /var/run/libvirt had permission root:root
# although the socket has permission root:libvirtd and
# nova user is part of the libvirtd group. This patch
# ensures that the socket's parent directory's permissions
